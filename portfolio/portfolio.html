                <p>I'm a senior in the Creative Technology & Design program at University of Colorado Boulder.
                    I strive to utilize my creative skillsets to better the developing world of media, constantly seeking to merge creativity and innovation in my projects. 
                    As someone passionate about UX/UI design, I enjoy learning more about
                    problem solving in creative ways. I hope to utilize my skillsets to create an impact on user experiences.
                    
                    <br> </br>
                    Born and raised in Aurora CO, I constantly seek to for adventures and enjoy experiencing new opportunities. I love being out in the sun and surrounding myself with friends and family!
                    As a Type-9 personality (also known as the "Peace-Keepers"), I tend to be very attentive and adaptive. Peacekeepers usually desire harmony and a conflict-diverse atmosphere.
                    We are mediators, which is why we value others' inputs. I am very motivated when it comes to supportive and collaborative group settings.
                    I hope this gives some perception of who I am and what I can provide in a work environment.
