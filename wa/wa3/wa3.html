                <strong>Pluto </strong> (minor-planet designation: <strong>134340 Pluto </strong>) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trans-Neptunian_object"> a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune.</a>
                It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass">massive</a> known object to directly orbit the Sun. 
                It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume, by a small margin, but is slightly less massive than Eris. 
                Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. 
                Pluto has only one sixth the mass of Earth's moon, and one third its volume.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from 30 to 49 astronomical units (4.5 to 7.3 billion kilometers; 2.8 to 4.6 billion miles) from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of 39.5 AU (5.91 billion km; 3.67 billion mi). Pluto's eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto; Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body, and they are tidally locked. The New Horizons mission was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, making a flyby on July 14, 2015 and taking detailed measurements and observations.

                    In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus's orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.[15]
                    In 1906, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percival_Lowell">Percival Lowell</a>—a wealthy Bostonian who had founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894—started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed "Planet X".[16] By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet.[17]
                     Lowell and his observatory conducted his search, using mathematical calculations made by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Langdon_Williams">Elizabeth Williams</a>, until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were.[17][18] There are fourteen other known precovery observations, with the earliest made by the Yerkes Observatory on August 20, 1909.[19]

                    The name Pluto is for the Roman god of the underworld, from a Greek epithet for Hades.
                    Upon the announcement of the discovery, Lowell Observatory received over a thousand suggestions for names.[22] Three names topped the list: <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MinervaMinerva">Minerva</a>, Pluto and Cronus. 'Minerva' was the Lowell staff's first choice[23] but was rejected because it had already been used for an asteroid; Cronus was disfavored because it was promoted by an unpopular and egocentric astronomer, Thomas Jefferson Jackson See. A vote was taken, and 'Pluto' was the unanimous choice. To make sure the name stuck, and that the planet would not suffer changes in its name as Uranus had, Lowell Observatory proposed the name to the American Astronomical Society and the Royal Astronomical Society; both approved it unanimously.[14]: 136 [24] The name was published on May 1, 1930.[25][26]
                    The name 'Pluto' had received some 150 nominations among the letters and telegrams sent to Lowell. The first[h] had been from Venetia Burney (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who was interested in classical mythology.[25][14] She had suggested it to her grandfather Falconer Madan when he read the news of Pluto's discovery to his family over breakfast; Madan passed the suggestion to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to colleagues at Lowell on March 16, three days after the announcement.[25][23]
